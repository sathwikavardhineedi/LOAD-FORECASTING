# ENERGY LOAD ANALYSIS

The Energy Load Analysis project is designed to analyze electricity consumption trends over time using historical load data. By leveraging data preprocessing and visualization techniques, this project helps identify patterns in energy demand and compare trends across different years.

## Features
- Parses and processes timestamped load data.
- Filters and visualizes load trends for specific dates.
- Supports comparison of energy consumption across multiple years.
- Implements data smoothing for improved trend visualization.
- Provides insights into peak and off-peak consumption patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sathwikavardhineedi/LOAD-FORECASTING.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd load-forecasting
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Dataset
- **Source:** Provided CSV dataset with historical energy consumption data.
- **Time Range:** January 1, 2018, to December 12, 2020.
- **Attributes:**
  - `datetime`: Timestamp of the recorded load.
  - `load`: Energy consumption in megawatts (MW).

## Results
- **Processed & cleaned timestamped energy data.**
- **Visualized load trends for December 14 in previous years.**
- **Identified peak energy usage periods.**

## Future Work
- Expand analysis to include predictive modeling for future energy consumption trends.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.
- Integrate external weather and economic factors for more in-depth insights.
